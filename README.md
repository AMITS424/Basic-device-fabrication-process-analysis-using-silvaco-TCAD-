Technology CAD (Technology Computer Aided Design) is a branch of electronic design automation that models semiconductor fabrication and semiconductors device operation. This repository contains pdf files describing analysis of various device fabrication steps such as oxidation, diffusion and ion implantation with diferent parameters like temp, dose etc.

## TCAD:
Technology CAD (Technology Computer Aided Design) is a branch of electronic design automation that models semiconductor fabrication and semiconductors device operation.

a)	Modelling fabrication : ATHENA

b)	Modelling device operation: ATLAS

SILVACO is used just like virtual fab.

## EXAMPLE OF PROCESS STEPS FOR FABRICATION OF DEVICE

1-Oxidation ,

2-Lithography ,

3-Etching, 

4-Diffusion ,

5-ion implantation 

6- Metallization

## Some Basic Commands:

Init: Define initial substrate

Deposit : layer deposition

ETCH: Etching

Implant: ion implantation

Diffusion: diffusion

Electrode: specification of electrodes

Struct: saving structure file
